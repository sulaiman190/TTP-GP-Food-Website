			<h2>Fufu</h2>
			<p><img class="myImg" src="images/fufu.jpg"></p>
			<p class="paraIntro">
				Fufu is made from boiled unripe plantain and cassava, which is pounded and kneaded. It is pounded using a wooden pestle and mortar.<br>
				Fufu is a starchy staple across Africa. In Ghana it is prepared with cassava, plantain, cocoyam and yam. In some countries, it is prepared with potatoes, bananas, cornmeal and semolina.<br> Fufu can be eaten with a variety of soups such as, palm-nut, peanut, and light soups among others.<br>

				Some Ghanaians love fufu so much that a day without fufu equals starving. However, the tedious job associated with pounding fufu has made many given up on their favorite dish.<br>

				One could pound fufu for about 30 minutes, whilst another navigates the mixture to achieve a smooth texture.<br>

				Some children and even adults, go into hiding whenever it’s time to pound fufu for the family. Others feign sickness to escape pounding fufu. The funny aspect is, they come back home to enjoy after it’s pounded and ready to eat.

				Everybody loves fufu but nobody wants to be tasked with the job of pounding it. Over time, food bloggers and caterers have been exploring ways fufu could be enjoyed without the hustle of pounding and it has paid off.
